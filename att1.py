Follow the instructions explained in the problem video and try to implement a solution on your own. Compare it with my solution (video + downloadable files) thereafter.

1) Create two variables â€“ one with your name and one with your age

2) Create a function which prints your data as one string

3) Create a function which prints ANY data (two arguments) as one string

4) Create a function which calculates and returns the number of decades you already lived (e.g. 23 = 2 decades)
